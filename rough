it will parse my commands sturct then based on the matches it will work
* is chutiye project webage will be made by ai and designed by the girl
who knows ui/ux
* if the time permits i will use tsoding's nn.h file to write the advanced brain and
neural network for smart command handling
* since the project language is c the brainfuck to add voice to text message is another
mental torture and then using the same fuzzy logic we will compare
